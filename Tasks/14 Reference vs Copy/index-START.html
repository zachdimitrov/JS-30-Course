        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        // one way
        const team2 = players.slice();

        // with Objects

            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80

        const captain = person;
        // how do we take a copy instead?
